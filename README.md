# Hello GitHub Actions

_Create and run a GitHub Actions workflow._

## Step 1: Create a workflow file

_Welcome to "Hello GitHub Actions 👋🏻"! :wave:_

**What is _GitHub Actions_?**: GitHub Actions is a flexible way to automate nearly every aspect of your team's software workflow. You can automate testing, continuously deploy, review code, manage issues and pull requests, and much more. The best part, these workflows are stored as code in your repository and easily shared and reused across teams. To learn more, check out these resources:

- The GitHub Actions feature page, see [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
- The "GitHub Actions" user documentation, see [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions).

**What is a _workflow_?**: A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined in special files in the `.github/workflows` directory and they execute based on your chosen event. For this exercise, we'll use a `pull_request` event.

- To read more about workflows, jobs, and events, see "[Understanding GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)".
- If you want to learn more about the `pull_request` event before using it, see "[pull_request](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request)".

To get you started, we ran an Actions workflow in your new repository that, among other things, created a branch for you to work in, called `welcome-workflow`.

### :keyboard: Activity: Trigger the workflow

1. Make a new branch named `test-workflow`.
1. Make a change, such as adding an emoji to your README.md file, and commit the change directly to your new branch.
1. In the **Pull requests** tab, create a pull request that will merge `test-workflow` into `main`.
1. Watch the workflow running in the checks section of the pull request.
1. Notice the comment that the workflow adds to the pull request.
1. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). Another workflow will run and will replace the contents of this README file with instructions for the next step.
